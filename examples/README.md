# Examples

Ideas and examples of other configuration that could be possible with Argo and tooling. They might not work out-of-the-box, and they are __not__ connected with Argo and the bootstrap scripts at the root.

- __helm-only__: an example to show how to compose environments without using Kustomize, but only Helm and appsets.
